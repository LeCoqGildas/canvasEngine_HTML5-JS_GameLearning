First, i use the CanvasEngine Framework http://canvasengine.net/

The current game is an platform game (as mario)
what is made:

-The preload scene (load bar),<br>
-A title scene (two button to choos play, or option)<br>
-The world load, you can insert an world (json), to creat this i use TiledMapEditor http://www.mapeditor.org/download.html<br>
-The game player with move, gravity, jump...<br>
-Collision between the game player and platforms<br>
-Scrolling (but it's not work, with collision, the collision spaces not move with the scrolling effect, try for hunerstand the problem! :) )<br>
<br>
Good games!
